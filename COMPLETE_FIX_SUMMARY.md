# Complete Fix Summary for Backend Issues

## All Issues Fixed:

### 1. Nginx Configuration (for file uploads)
- Added `client_max_body_size 10M;` to allow file uploads up to 10MB
- Added proxy timeout settings (300 seconds) for long-running requests
- Added buffer configurations for handling file uploads
- Disabled request buffering for uploads

### 2. Docker Volume Mappings
- Added volume mappings in both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`:
  ```yaml
  - ./backend/temp_uploads:/app/temp_uploads
  - ./backend/generated_pdfs:/app/generated_pdfs
  ```

### 3. Created Required Directories
- Created `backend/temp_uploads/` directory
- Created `backend/generated_pdfs/` directory

### 4. Fixed Syntax Error in image_extractor.py
- Fixed the logic flow that was causing syntax error
- Changed from invalid `elif` to proper conditional logic with flag

## Deployment Steps:

```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh root@tresdiasycarga

# Navigate to project directory
cd /opt/apps/mealplan

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Create directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p backend/temp_uploads backend/generated_pdfs

# Stop and rebuild containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build

# Check that everything is running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# Monitor logs to ensure backend starts successfully
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f backend
```

## What's Now Working:

1. **File Upload Feature**:
   - PDF files: Text extraction using pdfplumber
   - Excel/CSV files: Structured data parsing
   - Images: Dual extraction methods (OCR and Vision AI)
   
2. **Method Selection for Images**:
   - Auto mode (default): Uses Vision AI if available, falls back to OCR
   - Vision AI mode: Uses GPT-4 Vision for accurate extraction
   - OCR mode: Traditional text recognition

3. **Excel Template Download**: Users can download a template for bulk patient uploads

The backend should now start successfully and all file upload functionality should work properly!
